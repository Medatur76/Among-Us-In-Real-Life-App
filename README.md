## Role Choosing and how to do it:

As we all know, there are 2 roles (I know, there are _6_ but you cant do them in _real life_, except for the medic which _will come out soon_).
If you dont know what they are then here:    
![Crewmate](https://github.com/Medatur76/Among-Us-In-Real-Life-App/blob/master/Among%20Us%20APP/Pictures/Crewmate.jpg)

## Tasks

Task are the one way to win as crewmate. So we have em, if your using multiple divices for roles, then the tasks will apear after the role is found. If you dont hva multiple divices then you can use the print option. It will print out a list of the tasks. If you dont want to print em out, you can write em. There will be a section on tasks inwhitch you can do em. The only one that requires a divice to do it is the download task. _**NOTE**: For the download task, its is perferd you use a flashdrive that is [setup](https://github.com/Medatur76/Among-Us-In-Real-Life-App#flash-drive-setup) for the task_ The list of tasks are on the application!
